# REACTION DRILLS

For throws and lows, [original video from Phidx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N2MtFtRjOY&list=PLeW_6dl3UNQzqlvAxwDAPmLmdFPzzy85a&ab_channel=PhiDX)

## Most of the stuff is reactable

- 25+ frames means reactable in every situation
- 21 frames are hard to react to
- Hellsweeps are hard to react to
- Throws are 10-12f + 20f window for reaction = 30-32f => REACTABLE!

## Level 1 - SLOWEST LOWS AVAILABLE - BRYAN

1. SNAKE EDGE (low 29f) - 1 mins
2. b+1 (mid 20f) - 1 mins
3. SNAKE EDGE vs b+1 - 3 mins

- Do not crouch, but REACT and block low at the last moment
- Do every exercise until you are comfortable, let's say 20-30 reps
- It is important to be slow and correct, do not go fast and wrong
- The goal is 100% accuracy of your inputs
- After you are comfortable with the animations, proceed with step 2 and then 3 of this drill
- This is how Pakistani players train for lows

## Level 2 - THROWS - DRAGUNOV

1. 1 vs 1+2 throw
2. 2 vs 1+2 throw
3. 1 vs 2 throw
4. 1 vs 2 vs 1+2 throw

- Do not look at the arms only, but also at the legs and body
- It is best to watch the whole opponent model animation

```
Master these drills and you will excel at blue ranks in terms of defense!

You, of course, need to work on attack at the same time.
```

## Level 3 - Reaction the hard way - DRAGUNOV

1. Throws from the previous drill
2. Snake edge (db+3) - 1 mins
3. Snake edge and feint & low and catch (db3 + 1+2) - 1 mins => fuzzy duck, block, and stand up
4. b+4, 3 (this could have a variant where Dragunov does a mid) - 1 mins
5. Everything above random, do this only after you are comfortable with everything above - 5 mins

```
This is CHALLENGING: be patient and give yourself the time
```

## Level 4 - Even more hard reaction drill - LAW (turn heat off)

1. Dragon tail (db+4) [26f - fastest snake edge] => react and launch
2. Flipkick (UF+4) => launch punish
3. Hopkick (uf+4) => 13f punish
4. 4,3~f DSS f2 => duck and launch
5. uf+1, 3 => low parry
6. b+1, 2, 2 => 14f punish, DO NOT FUZZY LOW PARRY

- Speedkicks came up with this drill
- Phi does this before every ranked session
- Punish every time you block/duck successfully
- Low parry only if you see correctly (5)
- The key is accuracy over speed

## Level 5 - The hardest, some could say this is impossible - JIN

1. Deep dash ff+3,1 <-- do not heat this => the goal is to not be hit
2. Dash df1, 4 => duck and launch
3. Dash df1, 4 ~ 4 => block and punish
4. Dash cd 4 => react and launch (look at the shoulder to recognize the animation)
5. Dash db4 => fuzzy block and punish
6. d+2 => fuzzy block and punish

```
Master this drill and you will be at Tekken God tournament level
```

- After getting the animations, turn off all the frame info
- Do not overgrind => practice for no more than 15 minutes and then go to ranked
- Speedkicks came up with this drill
