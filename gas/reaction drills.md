## Most of stuff is reactable

- > = 25 frames means reactable in every situations
- 21 frames are hard to react
- hellsweep are hard to react
- Throws are 10-12f + 20f window for reaction = 30-32f => REACTABLE!

## Level 1 - SLOWES LOWS AVAILABLE - BRYAN

1. SNAKE EDGE ( low 29f )
2. b+1 ( mid 20f )
3. SNAKE EDGE vs b+1

- do not crouch, but REACT and block low at the last time
- do every exercises until you are comfable, let say 20-30 reps
- is important to be slow and correct, do not go fast and wrong
- the goal is an 100% accuracty of your imputs
- after you are comftable with the animations, go on with step 2 and then 3 of this drill
- This is how Pakistani players train for lows

## Level 2 - THROWS - DRAGUNOV

1. 1 vs 1+2 throw
2. 2 vs 1+2 throw
3. 1 vs 2 throw
4. 1 vs 2 vs 1+2 throw

- do not look to arms only, but also to legs and body
- is best to watch the whole opponent model animation

```
Master these drills and you will cook at blue ranks in term of defense!

You offcourse need to work on attack at the same time.
```

## Level 3 - Reaction the hard way - DRAGUNOV

1. throws previous drill
2. snake edge ( db+3 )
3. snake edge and faint & low and catch ( db3 + 1+2 ) => fuzzy duck, block and stand up
4. b+4, 3 ( this could have a variant where drag does a mid)
5. everything above random, do this only after you are conftable in everything above

```
This is CHALLENGING: be patient and give you the time
```

## Level 3.5 - Even more hard reaction drill - LAW ( turn heat off )

1. dragon tail ( db+4 ) [ 26f - fastest snake edge ]
2. flipkick ( UF+4 )
3. hopkick (uf+4)
4. 4,3~f DSS f2 => duck and launch
5. uf+1, 3
6. b+1, 2, 2

- Phi do this before every ranked session
- punish every time you block/duck successfully
- low parry only if you see correctly (5)
- the key is accuracy over speed

## Level 4 - The hardest, someone could say this is impossible - JIN

1. deep dash ff+3,1 <-- do not heat this => the goal is to not be hit
2. dash df1, 4 => duck and launch
3. dash df1, 4 ~ 4 => block and punish
4. dash cd 4 => react and launch ( see at the shoulder to recognize the animation)
5. dash db4 => fuzzy block and punish
6. d+2 => fuzzy block and punish

```
