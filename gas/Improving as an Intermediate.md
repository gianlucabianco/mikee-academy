**Improving as an Intermediate Tekken 8 Player - PART 1**

Focus on:

1. **Efficient Matchup Learning**: Understanding and practicing punishable moves through drills and in-game experience.
2. **Knowledge Retention**: Determining what’s crucial to remember, like character animations, common punishable moves, and fundamental concepts, while filtering out less critical information.
3. **Combating Internal Flowcharts**: Breaking repetitive habits by recognizing personal patterns and intentionally diversifying responses.

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Developing Matchup Knowledge**

   - Begin with block punish practice for various characters using frame data or punishment training.
   - Familiarize yourself visually with punishable moves, focusing on recognition rather than memorization.
   - Test your knowledge in matches to refine reactions and responses, noting moves you struggle with for future practice.
   - Document tricky moves in a way you can revisit before future matches (e.g., Google Docs or screenshots).

2. **Identifying Important Information**

   - Focus on recognizing opponent animations, especially high, mid, or low moves, as visual cues lead to better reaction times.
   - Recognize common patterns in moves, like multi-hit strings ending in mid typically being unsafe or high strings being safer.
   - Ignore hyper-specific setups or lengthy combos initially, prioritizing consistency in basic punishments.

3. **Using Replays to Close Knowledge Gaps**

   - After each match, review replays and analyze situations where you struggled, specifically what hits you and what you missed punishing.
   - Experiment with the practice mode to recreate challenging scenarios, testing out moves and responses.

4. **Building Strong Defensive Intuition**

   - Practice paying close attention to opponent limb movements rather than just your character.
   - Use the in-game punishment trainer on hard mode with specific moves to condition yourself to watch for animations rather than instructions.

5. **Streamlining Drill Practices**

   - Focus on a few punishable moves per character; start with high-frequency moves you encounter in matches.
   - Try drilling block punishment by blocking twice and punishing on the third attempt. Gradually increase complexity by mixing up move sequences.

6. **Recording Knowledge and Building Mental Links**

   - Use notes or screenshots to document punishable moves for specific characters you encounter often.
   - Update and review this list periodically, paying special attention to characters that give you the most trouble.

7. **Breaking Internal Flowcharts and Habits**

   - Actively identify and challenge repetitive patterns in your gameplay. For example, if you always respond with the same move in certain situations, force yourself to try different responses.
   - Practice breaking habits in ranked matches for a realistic environment.

8. **Experimenting with Situational Moves and Risk Assessment**

   - Identify when to vary your responses based on the opponent’s tendencies (e.g., checking if they mash, block, or duck in certain situations).
   - Evaluate risk vs. reward in opponent moves, especially lows; if the opponent risks something high, the punishment should be proportional.

9. **Adopting Defensive Moves as Needed**

   - For persistent offensive threats like hopkicks, practice a simple response like jabs or blocking, even if it feels less flashy, to ensure consistency.

10. **Using Frame Advantage Effectively**

- Observe when you have frame advantage and practice using it to set up your own mixups while watching for opponent tendencies to block or mash.
