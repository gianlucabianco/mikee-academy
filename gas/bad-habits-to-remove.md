# Bad habits to remove

## 1. - Avoid unsafe moves

    Don’t use moves / strings that leave you vulnerable.

    Break combos or add delays when necessary.

## 2. - Don’t press buttons after being hit

    Instead of counterattacking right away, block.

    Wait for the situation to reset.

## 3. - Take advantage of positive frames

    When you have frame advantage, take the initiative and attack.

## 4. - Don’t overuse strings

    Mix up your game.

    Do not finish your strings.

    Predictable strings can be easily punished.

## 5. - Balance offense and defense

    Don’t always be aggressive.

    Sometimes it's better to defend.

## 6. - Use armor moves sparingly

    Don’t rely too much on armor moves.

    They can become predictable.

## 7. - Avoid whiffing attacks

    Don’t attack when you’re too far from your opponent.

    It’s risky ( you will be launched ).

## 8. - Use dash block

    Approach your opponent while blocking, not always attacking.

## 9. - Side step wisely

    Don’t overuse side stepping, especially when you're at a disadvantage.

## 10. - Learn to break throws

    If you frequently use throws, make sure you know how to counter your opponent's throws as well.

## 11. - Punish unsafe moves

    Even a simple jab is better than nothing.

    Gradually improve your punish game.

## 12. - Dodge high attacks

    Learn to recognize and avoid high attacks in strings.

## 13. - Be aware of your character's flaws

    Some characters can foster bad habits.

    Compensate by learning the game’s mechanics well.

## 14. - Play in good conditions

    Don’t play when you're hungry or tired.

    It affects your performance.

## 15. - Control your anger

    Don’t get angry over mistakes.

    Stay focused on the present and keep calm to play your best.
