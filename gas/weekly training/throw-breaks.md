# Throw Breaks

This training should be approached as mindfully as possible.

The goal here is to develop muscle memory to react successfully within a small time window. So do not rush; review as much as possible, focus on the animations first, and press the button only when you understand which throw to break.

## Instructions

- **Focus on animations first.**

  Pay attention to how the opponent's arms move; observe the animation of their entire 3D model.

- **Study landed throw animations.**

  This will help you recognize them during games and learn how to break them.

- **Vary your timing.**

  It should be a reaction. Try some backdashes, see the animation, then react.

- **Master one side before the other.**

  First, master throw breaking from one side, then practice the other side.

- **Note homing animations.**

  In some cases, there is a homing animation (TODO: verify in which cases).

### Throws Broken with 1

- The **left arm** is moved prominently.
- The whole body of the opponent moves toward your character, with the shoulder and face moving along the arm.
- The animation is **slower** than a 1+2 throw.

### Throws Broken with 2

- Same as above, but the arm is the **right one**, so everything is mirrored.

### Throws Broken with 1+2

- Both arms are moved forward **together**.
- The shoulders and face of the opponent move forward, and the axis of the face remains the same.
- The animation seems **faster**.
